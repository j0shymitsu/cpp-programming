# Introduction
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language that is an extension of the procedural C programming language.
- The GNU C++ compiler is available for Windows and Linux
- Preprocessor instructions are used to make functions within the standard C++ libraries available to a program.
- Statements define the actions that the program will execute.
- It is recommended that program code should be widely commented to make its purpose clear.
- the **c++** command calls the compiler and its **-o** option allows the command to specify the name of the generated executable.
- A variable declaration specifies a data type and a chosen name by which the value within that variable can be referenced.
- The **cout** function, which is part of the C++ **iostream** library, writes content to the standard output console.
- An array is a fixed size variable that stores multiple items of data in elements, which are numbered starting zero.
- The special **\0** character can be assigned to the final element of a **char** array to allow it to be treated as a single text string.
- A vector variable stores multiple items of data in elements and can be dynamically resized.
- The value stored in an array or vector element can be referenced using that variable's name and its index number.
- Variable values that are never changed by th program should be stored in a constant.
- A constant list can be automatically numbered by the **enum** keyword and given a type name by the **typedef** keyword.
