# Polymorphism
- The thre cornerstones of OOP are **encapsulation, inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.
- Polymorphic entities have a different meaning, or purpose, according to their context.
- A base class pointer can be used to call inherited methods in the derived class to which it is bound.
- A base class pointer can also be used to explicitly call base class methods using the **::** scope  resolution operator.
- Virtual base class methods are intended to be overridden in derived classes.
- Polymorphism allows calls to methods of the same name to be directed to the appropriate overriding method.
- Capability classes generally contain no data but merely declare virtual methods that can be overriden in derived classes.
- Virtual methods that return a **-1** value signal an error to indicate they should not be called directly
- An Abstract Data Type (ADT) represents a concept and is always the base to other classes.
- Declaration of a pure virtual method, with the assignation **=0**, indicates that class is an ADT.
- Classes can be derived from an ADT - but you cannot create an instance of an ADT
- An ADT can be derived from another ADT to create a complex hierarchy of classes.
- Programs can be separated into header, implementation, and client files to aid portability and to ease code maintenance.
- Header files that are referenced by **#include** directives will be automatically included by the compiler during compilation.
