# Performing Operations
- Arithmetical operators can form expressions with two operands for addition **+**, subtraction **-**, multiplication *, division **/**, or modulus **%**
- Increment **++** and decrement **--** operators modify a single operand by a value of one.
- The assignment **=** operator can be combined with a arithmetical operator to perform an arithmetical calculation then assign its result.
- Comparison operators can form expressions comparing two operands for equality **==**, inequality **!=**, greater **>**, lesser **<**, greater or equal **>=**, anmd lesser or equal **<=** values.
- Logical **&&** and **||** operators can form expressions comparing two operands to return a boolean value of true or false.
- The logical **!** operator returns the inverse boolean value of a single operand.
- A ternary **:?** operator evaluates a given boolean expression then returns one of two operands depending on its result.
- The **sizeof** operator returns the memory byte size of a variable.
- An **int** variable will only store positive numbers; it may be qualified as **unsigned** to extend its numeric range.
- It is important to explicitly set operator precedence in complex expressions by adding parentheses **()**.
- Data stored in a variable can be forced into a variable of a different data type by the casting process.
- C++ supports traditional C-style casts and the newer form of casts that use the **static_cast** keyword.
