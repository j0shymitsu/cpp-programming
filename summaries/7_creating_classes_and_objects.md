# Creating Objects and Classes
- The first principle of Object Oriented Programming is the encapsulation of data and functionality within a single class.
- Access specifiers **public**, **private**, and **protected** control the accessibility of class members from outside the class.
- A class declaration describes a data structure from which instance objects can be created.
- Public **setter** and **getter** class methods store and retrieve data from private class variable members.
- The scope resolution operator **::** can explicitly indentify a class.
- Class members that have the same name as a passed argument can be explicitly identified by the **this ->** pointer.
- A constructor method is called when an object gets created and a destructor method is called when it gets destroyed.
- Class variables can be automatically initialised by a constructor.
- Class methods can be overloaded like other functions.
- The second principle of Object Oriented Programming is the virtue of inheritance that allows derived classes to inherit the properties of their parent base class.
- In a derived class declaration, the class name is followed by a **:** colon character, an access specifier, and its base class name.
- When an instance of an object of a derived class is created the default constructor of the base class gets called in addition to the constructor of the derived class.
- A derived class method can override a matching method in its base class - Also overriding all overloaded methods of that name within the base class.
